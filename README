Simple English Wikipedia Page Rank

Database:
 - To create the tables, create a database called `simple_english_wikipedia` in
   mysql and source the ".sql" files
 - page_essential is a table of all the pages
   - `page_id` is the unique id of the page
   - `page_namespace` is the namespace of the article (like the category)
   - `page_title` is the name of the article (together, the namespace and title form a unique identifier for the page)
 - pl_essential is a table of all the links
   - `pl_from_id` is the id of the source page
   - `pl_to_id` is the id of the target page (turns out there are no repeated pairs of links)

Build Structures:
  - Go to the build_structures directory and run 'go run build_structures.go'"

Compute Pagerank:
  - Copy the generated .out files from the build_structures directory into the
    compute_pagerank directory
  - Run 'go run compute_pagerank.go' to run pagerank on the dataset
